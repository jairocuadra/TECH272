<h2>Web Design Freelancing</h2>
<p>
  My career in design began as a Web Design Freelancer in Gaithersburg, MD. This
  first role was a significant stepping stone, where I immersed myself in the
  practical aspects of web and digital design and also how to run a business,
  and get clients. It was a period of intense learning and growth, laying the
  groundwork for my future endeavors in UX/UI design. Working with diverse
  clients, I honed my skills in translating user needs into functional and
  aesthetically pleasing design solutions, setting the stage for my professional
  journey.
